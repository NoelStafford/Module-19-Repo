# Project Title
PWA: Text editor
## Description

Your task is to build a text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.

While building this project I learned to:

1.add virtuals to a model
2.use a NoSQL with monogDB

### Built With

JavaScript, Webpack, NodeJS, Babeel
